## Main goal

This project is about creating a simple shell.
<br>Yes, your own little bash.
<br>You will learn a lot about processes and file descriptors.


## Some other instructions

* Must be according to the [Norm](https://github.com/42School/norminette/blob/master/pdf/en.norm.pdf);
* Must be written in the C language;
* Must have a Makefile that compiles, delete and recompile the project;
* Implement each task using standard C library functions such as "fork", "execvp", "pipe", "dup", "waitpid", "getcwd", "chdir", "getenv", "setenv", " unsetenv", "signal", "sigaction" and "printf";
* Do not have memory leaks (The readline() function can cause memory leaks. You don’t have to fix them. But that doesn’t mean your own code, yes the code you wrote, can have memory leaks.);
